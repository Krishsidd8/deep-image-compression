## ðŸ“– Overview
This work presents a **lightweight, end-to-end deep learning architecture for image compression**, combining:

- **Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs)** â€“ for compact latent representation.  
- **Residual Blocks (ResBlocks)** â€“ for improved feature retention.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** â€“ for perceptual fidelity.  

The hybrid approach balances **compression ratio, pixel-level fidelity, and perceptual quality** while remaining deployable on **resource-constrained devices** (mobile, drones, IoT).

## ðŸš€ Features
- End-to-end training with **adaptive loss balancing**.  
- Ablation study on **CAE, CAE+ResBlocks, and CAE+ResBlocks+GAN**.  
- Benchmarked on **Microsoft Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset** (25k images).  
- Evaluated with **CR, PSNR, and SSIM** metrics.
