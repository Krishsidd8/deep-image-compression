This repository contains code and training procedures for a lightweight deep learning-based image compression model combining Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs), Residual Blocks (ResBlocks), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model is designed for edge applications where memory and compute resources are constrained.

## üîß Key Features

- **High Compression Ratio:** Up to 48:1 with CAE-only setup
- **ResBlock Integration:** Enhanced detail preservation
- **GAN-augmented Training:** Improved perceptual quality with adversarial learning
- **Loss Balancing:** Adaptive weighting between L1, LPIPS, and GAN losses
- **Ablation Studies:** Quantitative and visual comparison of CAE, CRB, and GCRB variants
